These are the mean beta values from the three Categorical Confidence
Design Matrices (10-12), per response and confidence. Each file is 
data from one ROI.
'conf_A' stands for confidence in anticlockwise responses (correct
and incorrect). Each row is one subject (in the order the appear in
the 'subjects' variable), and each column is one confidence level 
(from 1 to 6). The value is the mean beta value for this subset of
trials.
